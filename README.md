# Simple_tabletopRPG_number_generator

This is a basic skeleton of a bash script that will varify directory existance and file existance
If your filename already exists then the script will terminate asking you to rerun the script with a new name

Asides from this the script is meant to be modified to suit your needs
The underlined portions are meant to be changed

'/e/B&B 3rd cards/B&B_cutouts' is the placeholder direction of where the script points to.
Now as for the file name and syntax for using the script you will want to run as so ./cut-out-builder.sh "<whatever filename you would like>"
